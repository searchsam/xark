# XARK

Baby SAHRK hunting for device information without supervision.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Xark requires that you have python installed.

```bash
# Fedora 22 and higher
$ sudo dnf install python

# Fedora 21 and older
$ sudo yum install python
```

### Installing

Clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/searchsam/xark.git
```

or download the latest version of the [releases page](https://github.com/searchsam/xark/releases) and unzip it.

Go into the project folder and create a new `.env` file from `env.example` and filled with your environtment data.

```bash
$ mv env.example .env
```

once your `.env` file has the data of your environment run the `setup.sh` file

```bash
sh setup.sh
```

The `setup.sh` file among other things will create the file `xarkd.service`. The `xarkd.service` is a Systemd's Unit Service, copy this file to `/etc/systemd/system` to run Xark as a systemd service or at start system.

```bash
sudo cp xarkd.service /etc/systemd/system/. # Copy xarkd.serve to Unit Service
sudo systemctl start xarkd.service # Init Xark as Systemd Service
sudo systemctl enable xarkd.service # Init Xark at start system
```

Or just start Xark directly from the project folder wit python

```bash
python xark.py
```
